# api-ai-git
### Reason for creation:
This is a CLI tool to version control intents and entities in API.ai born out of a frustration of having them constantly mangled by other team members without a way to rollback to a working version.

### List of supported actions:
* Save current state of all intents and/or entities
* Update all intents and/or entities to be the same as a specified commit
* Update individual intent or entity to be same as a specified commit
